# Context Glossary

The shared, canonical vocabulary for this project. Terms are added as they are
resolved during design. This file is a glossary only — no implementation details.

## Inventory templates

- **Instrument template** — a reusable definition (name + custom fields) from which
  a user creates concrete Instruments. Persisted in the single-table
  `InstrumentEntity` hierarchy under `DTYPE='InstrumentTemplate'`; its sibling
  discriminator is the concrete `Instrument`.
- **Sample template** — the analogous reusable definition for Samples, in the
  `Sample`/`SampleTemplate` hierarchy. The instrument side is being brought to
  behavioural parity with it, not merged into it.
- **Default (system) template** — a template shipped by RSpace itself and made
  readable and duplicable by every user on every deployment, while remaining
  read-only to non-owners. The first such instrument template is named
  `Instrument (PIDINST 1.0)`: its fields map 1-to-1 to the PIDINST/B2INST payload.
  For samples the equivalents are the seeded standard templates (Antibody,
  Bacteria, etc.).
- **Default templates owner** — the single account that owns the default templates.
  All users may read (and therefore duplicate) any template owned by this account.
  For samples this account is resolved as the owner of the oldest template row,
  which is safe only because samples are seeded before any user can create one.
  For instruments the account is resolved explicitly as the sysadmin, because
  user-created instrument templates may already predate the default one.
- **Locked template** — a default template that cannot be edited, deleted, or
  transferred by anyone, enforced by a persisted `isEditable=false` flag rather
  than by ownership alone. Editability is a property of templates only: a
  concrete Instrument is never locked, and one created from a locked template is
  an ordinary, fully mutable instrument. Distinct from ordinary non-owner
  read-only access, which merely prevents *other* users from mutating a template
  they do not own.
- **Custom field** — a typed field that is part of a template's definition and is
  stamped onto every record created from that template (for the PIDINST template:
  Owner, Manufacturer, etc.).
- **Extra field** — an ad-hoc field (text, number or link) a user attaches to an
  individual record after creation, outside any template definition.

## Internationalization (i18n)

- **Canonical translation catalog** — i18next JSON. The runtime and
  translator-facing catalog format shared by the frontend and the backend's
  `JsonMessageSource`. English (`en-US`) text is authored in the base JSON;
  translated locale JSON is owned by the future translation workflow.
- **Namespace** — a named slice of translations, one per product module
  (`workspace`, `gallery`, `inventory`, `groups`, `dashboard`, `admin`, `apps`,
  `system`, `public`) plus a shared `common`. Loaded independently.
- **Base file** — the English (`en-US`) file for a namespace. The monolingual
  source/template every other locale is translated against. Locale codes are
  region-qualified BCP 47 and hyphenated (`en-US`, `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`) in catalog
  paths and at runtime.
- **Key** — a stable structured dot-notation identifier (`ns:section.name`) that
  names a string independently of its wording. Distinct from the **default
  value** stored in the base catalog.
- **Default value** — the English source string stored in the `en-US` base file.
  Mandatory for every key; copy changes start in the canonical base JSON.
- **ICU MessageFormat** — the message syntax used for all keys (plurals, gender/
  `select`, ordinals, inline number/date formatting).
- **Extraction** — the build step (via `i18next-cli`) that scans code for keys,
  adds missing entries to the `en-US` base files, and identifies unused keys.
  The same catalogs generate the TypeScript key types.
- **Ratchet** — the per-module enforcement progression: a converted module flips
  its `noJsxLiterals` lint rule to `error`, so the gated (fully-converted)
  surface only ever grows.
- **No-orchestration gap** — the period before Weblate is connected. While the
  product is English-only, this gap is invisible: every string falls back to its
  English default.
- **Locale** — a single BCP 47 tag (e.g. `de-DE`) that controls both the UI
  language (which translation catalog renders) and regional formatting (dates,
  numbers). One value, two effects; they are not independently configurable.
- **CSV-export carve-out** — machine-readable CSV exports are always formatted
  as `en-US` regardless of anyone's locale, so downstream parsers never see
  locale-dependent decimal separators or date formats.
- **First day of week** — fixed instance-wide, not part of a user's locale
  choice.
- **Bundled locale** — a locale whose translation catalog ships with the
  release. Only bundled locales can be allowed by a sysadmin.
- **Allowed set** — the sysadmin-chosen subset of bundled locales users may
  pick from. Always contains the instance default; never empty.
- **Instance default** — the locale served when no valid user choice applies,
  including to all anonymous visitors.
- **Effective locale** — the locale actually served: the user's stored choice
  if it is in the allowed set, otherwise the instance default. A stored choice
  outside the allowed set is kept (not erased) and springs back if re-allowed.
