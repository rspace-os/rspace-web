# Glossary

This file is just a glossary of terms that is used across the code base, both
in the naming of code constructs and in the comments surrounding them.

## A

### Accessibility

> Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, "a", then 11 characters,
> and then "y") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to
> use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way. —

### Action

[Mobx actions](https://mobx.js.org/actions.html) are functions or methods that
update state that is being managed by mobx. When the state is updated, any
computed properties that are being observed are re-computed and any observing
react components are re-rendered.

### Alt-text

A string that is associated with an image so that blind users using screen
readers can have the contents of the image described to them. For more
information, [see the MDN documentation on the `alt` attribute of
HTMLImageElements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt).

### Arbitrary

An arbitrary is a data structure used with the [fast-check testing
library](https://fast-check.dev/) that encapsulates the generation of random
values. It is paramaterised by a type that describes
the shape of the values that will be generated when the test is executed, for
example `fc.string()` generates random strings and has the type
`Arbitrary<string>`. These arbitraries can be composed and combined to generate
all manner of possible JavaScript objects. For more information, [see the
fast-check documentation on
Arbitraries](https://fast-check.dev/docs/introduction/getting-started/#arbitrary)
