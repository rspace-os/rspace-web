# Booking display preferences

Booking keeps presentation choices separate from scheduling rules:

- The **display timezone** and **availability window** come from the current user's Booking
  preference, falling back to the global Booking defaults. They control rendered dates and times,
  route-level “today”, booking-form wall clocks, availability domains, and the Now marker.
- The **scheduling timezone** remains on each `BookingConfiguration`. It controls opening-hour and
  slot-policy calculations and the timezone metadata in calendar feeds. Existing values are not
  rewritten.
- The **institution timezone** is the JVM default returned by the qualified
  `bookingInstitutionClock` bean. Booking does not define a deployment property and does not mutate
  the process timezone. This agrees with legacy RSpace code paths when their browser/session zone
  is absent; a valid legacy session zone can still differ.

Global display defaults are stored on the audited `BookingConfigurationDefaults` singleton. The
initial values are `08:00`–`18:00`, Browser mode, and no custom timezone. A user override is one
versioned JSON document stored under `BOOKING_DISPLAY_PREFERENCES` in the existing
`UserPreference` system. `BookingDisplayPreferencesManager` owns serialization, versioning,
validation, fallback, and preference access. Blank, corrupt, or unsupported stored documents fall
back to the current global values.

The current-subject REST API is:

```text
GET    /api/v2/users/me/booking-preferences
PUT    /api/v2/users/me/booking-preferences
DELETE /api/v2/users/me/booking-preferences
```

PUT is a complete replacement, not a patch. DELETE removes the logical override. During run-as,
the subject owns the preference and the actor remains available for audit context.

## REST API compatibility

The `timezone` field on `/api/v2/booking-configurations` is now read-only. It remains available in
GET responses as the item's scheduling timezone, but create, patch, and bulk requests that include
it receive the collection framework's normal `400 Bad Request` response. Public creates assign the
JVM-backed institution timezone. This is an immediate breaking change; internal Java manager
commands retain their timezone fields for fixtures and other trusted scheduling workflows.
