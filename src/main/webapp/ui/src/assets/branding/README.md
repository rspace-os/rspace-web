resource for developers working on the RSpace UI.

For each service, the folder contains
* logo.svg file,
* and an index.js file, which will include
  * LOGO_COLOR: the colour used in the background of the organisation's logo
  * ACCENT_COLOR: the colour used in the organisation's branding, with various shades
