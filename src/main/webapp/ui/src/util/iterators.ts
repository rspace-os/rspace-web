/**
 * This script contains a number of utility functions for working with
 * iterators and generators. Here are a few definitions used in this script:
 *   - Iterator           - An object that implements the iterator protocol,
 *                          which consists of a next() method that returns an
 *                          object with two properties: done and value.
 *   - Iterable           - An object that implements the iterable protocol,
 *                          by having a Symbol.iterator method that returns an
 *                          iterator.
 *   - Generator Function - Differentiated from regular functions by the
 *                          asterisk after the function keyword, when called
 *                          they do not initially execute, instead returning a
 *                          Generator that starts executing on the first `next`
 *                          call.
 *   - Generator          - An object returned by a generator function, which
 *                          conforms to both the iterable and iterator protocols.
 *   - yield              - A keyword that is used to pause and resume a
 *                          generator function. It returns the arguments passed
 *                          to the next() method.
 * For more information, see the MDN documentation on iterators and generators.
