 * We use the HTML Drag and Drop API[mdn] to provide support for dragging files

 * drop within a particular webpage, we use the DndKit library as it provides
 * an abstraction over touch and keyboard controls, other accessibility
 * considerations, and generic customisation; for more information see DndKit's
 * Architectural justification[dndkit-architecture].
 *
 * This module provides a custom react hook that, much like DndKit, handles the
 * logic of determining whether the user is currently hovering over the
 * dropzone. It also provides some utility components for ensuring a robust
 * user experience.

   * For this to work correctly, we must stop the events, such as onDragEnter
   * and onDragLeave, from propagating up to the parent dropzone so that the
   * inner dropzone becomes a carved out region of the parent dropzone where
   * the parent's functionality does not get invoked. As such, by default, when
   * this prop is true, we stop the events from propagating.
   *
   * However, there are also times when the events SHOULD be propagated because
   * the inner dropzone should also trigger the outer one. Again as an example,
   * the Gallery page displays a pop-up panel onto which files can be dropped
   * to upload into the current folder. We want the events to propagate up for
   * the parent dropzone's `open` to remain true and for the popup to stay
   * open.
