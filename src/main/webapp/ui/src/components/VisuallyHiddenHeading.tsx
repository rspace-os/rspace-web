 * standard on not skipping any heading levels. This is so that accessibility
 * tools, like screen readers, can give an accurate description of the layout
 * of the page.
 *
 * Unlike headings that are visible, there is no need to separately consider a
 * `component` prop as the `variant` prop can simply be the semantically
 * correct heading level. Given that this heading will never be shown, how MUI
 * chooses to style that tag is irrelevant.
