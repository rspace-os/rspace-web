/**
 * A roving tab index is a pattern used to allow a keyboard-centric user to
 * more efficiently move around the web page by grouping particular controls
 * together, such that tab and shift-tab enter and leave the group and the
 * arrow keys are used to move between the elements. As such, pressing tab
 * twice will skip over all of the elements in the group, which is much faster
 * than tabbing through them all.
 *
 * This custom hook provides an abstraction over implementing a roving tab
 * index for a one-dimensional list of elements, so that either the up and down
 * arrow keys provide navigation between the elements in the list, or the left
 * and right arrow keys dow. Tab and shift-tab move the user's focus out of the
 * list, and when they return the focus resumes on the last element in the list
 * that had focus.
 *
 * There are two parts to how this custom hook is to be used:
 *
 *   1. Attach the `eventHandlers` to the component that wraps all of the
 *      elements in the list. It is this that captures the keyboard events.
 *
 *   2. Pass a `tabIndex` and a `ref` to each element in the list by calling
 *      the `getTabIndex` and `getRef` functions respectively with each
 *      element's index.
 *
 * For more information on roving tab index, see these sites:
