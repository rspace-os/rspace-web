/*
 * This is an unfortunate hack, for which there doesn't seem to be a better
 * alternative. An attempt was made to have this code run as part of the webpack
 * config, thereby ensuring that no matter where tinymce is used this setup is
 * performed. However, this resulted in the tinymce widget simply rendering as a
 * blank region of the webpack with no console errors. Not at all clear why, and
 * with little to help debug the underlying issue, this hack seems necessary.
 * As such, be careful when using tinymce in other components directly to ensure
 * that they do not depend on this component being rendered on the page to
 * correctly do this setup and also be aware that there is the possibility of
 * race conditions where this component is used multiple times on the same page.
