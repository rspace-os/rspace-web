 * then adjust as apppropiate. Assuming that all tests that use this function
 * have been written correctly and do not depend on the currently fixed values,
 * making the additional properties randomly generated should not cause any
 * failures.
 *
 * The value has to be just the attrs, rather than SubSampleModel, because
 * Arbitraries must be instances of the fast-check Arbitrary class. Instead, if
 * an instanceof SubSampleModel is required then call `makeMockSubSample`
 * inside of the Property testing, passing the randomly generated attrs.
