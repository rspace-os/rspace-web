/*
 * Dryad uses OAuth based authentication, as implemented by this form.
 *
 * The process of connection is:
 *   1. This form POSTs to /apps/dryad/connect in a new window, which
 *      redirects to the Dryad authentication page.
 *   2. Once the user has authenticated, Dryad redirects the window
 *      to RSpace's redirect URL with a temporary code in the search params.
 *   2. The RSpace backend records the passed code, converts it into an
 *      authentication token which is stored, and redirects the window again to
 *      ../../../../../WEB-INF/pages/connect/dryad/connected.jsp.
 *   3. That page then dispatches an event back to this page reporting that the
 *      connection was successful and closes itself.
 *   4. This component listens for that event and updates the UI accordingly.
 *
 * The reasons for this round-about system is so that the user is not
 * redirected away from the new apps page. It is a React-based Single Page
 * Application (SPA), and thus provides the best user experience by maintaining
 * state (e.g. keeping the user in the dialog they were just in, displaying
 * success alerts, etc.).
 *
 * The process of disconnecing is via a standard API call made by
 * ../useDryad.
