 * have re-write all of the code that displays alerts in Inventory to use the
 * context-based approach, whilst still being able to use the context-based
 * approach under the hood so that we only need one way to display alerts in
 * the codebase. Reworking Inventory to use the context-based approach would
 * be particularly difficult because there are various places in the code that
 * rely on the fact that UiStore is accessible as a global variable because
 * they are not inside the react runtime.
 *
 * This file is called Alert, even though the component Outer is exported,
 * because including it in the Inventory pages has the same effect as
 * including the general Alert component (../../components/Alerts/Alerts) and
 * should be used in the same way.
