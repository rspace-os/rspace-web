/**
 * This component renders form fields specifically used by the main Inventory
 * forms to create, view, and edit samples, subsamples, containers, and
 * templates. It MUST NOT be used anywhere else as it has some esoterical
 * behaviour specific to this use case. For all other forms, use the form field
 * component in ../../../components/Inputs/FormField.js
 *
 * Inventory form fields are used not just when editing and creating records
 * but also when viewing them. The fields are simply disabled and the styles
 * modified to ensure that they continue to have sufficient contrast. This is a
 * bit of hack to simplify the code but is worth keeping as it leaves open the
 * option to allow for editing each field of these forms separately, rather
 * than having to enter a completely separate edit mode.
 *
 * Furthermore, Inventory records can be batch edited with multiple records of
 * the same type being able to simultaneously have their fields set to the same
 * value. This adds more complexity that isn't necessary elsewhere.

   * If this is specified then there is no need to also pass it to the
