 * behaviour specific to this use case. For all other forms, use the form field
 * component in ../../../components/Inputs/FormField.js
 *
 * Inventory form fields are used not just when editing and creating records
 * but also when viewing them. The fields are simply disabled and the styles
 * modified to ensure that they continue to have sufficient contrast. This is a
 * bit of hack to simplify the code but is worth keeping as it leaves open the
 * option to allow for editing each field of these forms separately, rather
 * than having to enter a completely separate edit mode.
