  title: RSpace API
  description: >
    Welcome to the RSpace API. This API enables you to search for and retrieve
    your ELN data. It contains methods to create documents, upload files, and
    search, share and retrieve them.

    This documentation enables you to interactively explore the API using your
    own data, and to generate `curl` and client code snippets.


    API endpoints require client to be authenticated, so to use this documentation
    interactively you need to click on 'Authorize' button below and authenticate
    with your preferred method.

    #### Authentication with an API key

    To create an API key go to 'Manage API Key' section of your profile page
    (MyRSpace -> Profile). You should keep your API key private. You can
    regenerate API key at any time, which will invalidate the old key.

    #### Authentication with OAuth

    We have limited support for OAuth 'password' grant flow using `/oauth/token`
    endpoint. You can register OAuth app on your profile page (My RSpace -> Profile).
    For more information check our [Github documentation](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial/blob/master/oauth.md).


    Note: when using OAuth with this interactive documentation change 'type' option
    of 'Authorize' dialog from default 'Request body' to 'Query parameters'.

    #### Versioning notes

    The current _API_ version of the API is `version 1` and all URL paths begin
    with /api/v1. Incremental changes to the API will be backwards compatible.
    In practice, we'll be adding new methods, but keeping the old ones
    unchanged.


    The version of the API specified in the  `version` field of this
    documentation indicates the specific implementation version, and is tied to RSpace version.


    If you always work with a single instance of RSpace, code you write using the API should always work in future versions of that RSpace. If, however, you use more than one RSpace (perhaps you have an account on Community and an Enterprise account),  then code developed against a later implementation version of the API may not work on an earlier version running on a different  RSpace as the methods may not exist on the earlier version. See our full [Api
    Changelog](https://researchspace.helpdocs.io/article/dj4l39d70d-api-changelog)
    for details.

    #### Language support

    A high-level overview of API usage can be found on our [Github
    page](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial). We are also  developing
    rich language bindings and example code for `Python`, `Java` and others.
    Please suggest any use-cases or ideas for improving the API!

        The Documents endpoint returns a paginated list of summary information
        about  Documents in the RSpace workspace. These can be individual
        documents or notebook entries.

        The default number returned is 20; the maximum in a single query is
        50.   The default sort order is by descending modification date. I.e,
        most recently modified documents are returned first.

      summary: Create a new document
      description: >-

        The POST request sent to `/documents` endpoint creates a new document in
        the   Workspace.

        The request body should be a JSON object that specifies the details  of
        the document that should be created and must be parsable into
        #/definitions/Document model. All properties are optional, so an empty
        JSON  object `{}` is a valid request body that will create an empty
        document.

        The `name`, `tags`, `form`, `parentFolderId` and `fields` properties are
        read from the JSON object attached to the POST request, and are
        processed according to  the rules described below.

        See also [creating Document
        section](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial#creating-documents)
        of our [Github API tutorial](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial).

        ## Rules for parsing POST request body

        Provided request body must match #definitions/Document model (see the
        bottom of the page). Only `name`, `tags`, `form`, `parentFolderId` and
        `fields` properties are processed, other properties are skipped.

        ### When parsing `name` and `tags` properties:
          * the properties may be omitted
          * if provided, should be valid `name` or `tags` for the document
          * `tags` are saved by populating the `tags` field, any values in the `tagMetaData` field are ignored
          * If `enforceOntologies` is true then API document creation that would add tag values will be rejected.

        ### When parsing `form` property:
          * `form` property can be left empty, in such case 'Basic Document' form
            will be used. This form has one text field
          * alternatively, specific form can be selected by providing either id
            or global ID property

        ### When parsing `parentFolderId` property:

          * The folder ID must be the id of a folder in the Workspace, *not* a Gallery folder or a subfolder of the 'Shared' folder.
          * If no folderID is provided, document will be created in 'ApiInbox' folder.

        ### When parsing `fields` array:
          * `fields` array may be omitted - that will create document without any content.
          * if `fields` array is provided, its size MUST match the number of fields in form
            (e.g. one element for Basic Document form)

        ### When parsing `fields` array elements:
          * each element will be matched to the field in form with the same index
          * each element may be an empty object (`{}`), which means that paricular field
            shouldn't have any content set when creating a document
          * each element may provide `name` or `type` value which, if provided, MUST match
            the name and type of field in form
          * each element will have its `content` validated against any validation set for
            the field in form

        ## Different field types and their content.
          In RSpace every document contains a list of fields, and each field has a type.
          How many and which fields the document has depends on the form it is based on.
          The default `Basic Document` form has a single text type field, which can store
          any content, as well as links to Gallery files. Other forms may have fields of
          different types, and when using the API to create documents based on such forms
          API client must provide the content matching the required fields format and
          validation rules set in form definition.

          When creating a form, there are seven field types to choose from:
           * `text` - represents html content, may include complex elements like sketches
              or chemical drawings (added through the main app) and Gallery attachments
              (images or files) which can be added through main app or API
           * `string` - represents short text content
           * `number` - represents numeric value, may have some validation rules
           * `choice` - represents multiple-choice field with predefined options
           * `radio`  - represents single-choice field with predefined options
           * `date`   - represents a date in particular format, may have some validation rules
           * `time`   - represents a time in particular format, may have some validation rules
           * `reference` - a comma separated list of GlobalId references to other RSpace resources
           * `attachment` a file to upload and store
           * `uri` A valid URI string; for example a link to an external resource.

        ## Attaching Gallery files to the document.
          * Files previously uploaded to RSpace Gallery can be attached to the content of the
            text field. The result will be identical to using  'Insert from Gallery' functionality
            in the main app
          * to attach an image or other document put the &lt;fileId=`ID`&gt; tag into the content
            of text  field content, where `ID` should be replaced with id of the Gallery file
          * linking to audio/video files is currently not supported

        ## Linking to other documents/folders/notebooks
          * You can add links to other RSpace content like documents/folders/notebooks if you know their ID, using syntax &lt;docId=`ID`&gt;.

          * The result will be rendered in the web UI in exactly the same way
             as if you had pasted the link or added an 'Internal Link' in the web application.


        ## Examples of the request body

        | Body | Explanation |

        | --- | --- |

        `{}` | Creates a document named "Untitled document", based on Basic
        Document form, with empty content.

        `{ "name": "My Document", "tags": "API", "fields": [ { "content": "ABC"
        } ]}` | Creates a document named "My Experiment", based on Basic
        Document form, with `ABC` content.

        `{ "name": "My Experiment", "form": { "id": 2 } }` | Creates a new
        document based on form with id = 2, and empty content.

        More advanced examples can be found in out [Github API
        tutorial](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial#creating-and-editing-multi-field-documents).

      summary: Create a new version of a document with given ID
      description: >
        The PUT request sent to `/documents/{docId}` endpoint creates a new
        revision  of a document with given `docId`.

        The request body should be a JSON object that specifies the details  of
        the update, and must be parsable into #/definitions/Document model.  All
        properties are optional, so empty JSON object `{}` is a valid request
        body that will create new revision of a document.

        See also [editing existing
        content](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial#editing-existing-content-in-a-basic-document)
        section of our [Github API
        tutorial](https://github.com/rspace-os/api-tutorial).

        ## Rules for parsing PUT request body

        `docId` has to be provided as a path parameter, but may be omitted from
        JSON document passed in body.

        Only fields that should change can to be provided, e.g. if the request
        should only change document's name, then document body in form of `{
        "name" : "new name" }` is enough.

        `form` field is not needed, but if provided, its `id` parameter MUST
        match the id of the document's form.

        ### Updating document name or tags
          * If `name` or `tags/tagMetaData` are provided, they should be valid `name` or `tags` for the document
          * The `tags` field may only contain tag values. **The API may not save tagMetaData.** Values in the
        tagMetaData field of API updates are ignored. If tag values are unchanged,
        existing tagMetaData is unchanged in the DB. If the API creates new tagValues, they will be saved to tagMetaData
        as values with no meta data and will appear in the UI as 'local ontology'.

        * Tag values MUST replace commas in the tag value with __rspactags_comma__ and forward slashes with __rspactags_forsl__ or API updates will be rejected.
        Tag values are still comma delimited

        * Tag values must not contain "<", ">", "\" or "/" - or API updates will be rejected.

        * Its possible to erase ALL tag and tagMetaData for a document by updating with a tags or tagMetaData value of "" (empty string)

        * If the API contains NO VALUE for tags, the existing tags will remain unchanged.

        * If `enforceOntologies` is true for any group the user belongs to, then any API update that would create NEW tags will be rejected. Existing
        tags may still be deleted.

        * Therefore, if a document already contains meta data values in its tagMetaData field for 'a value', the following PUT request
        will leave existing tagMeta data unchanged:
        ```
        {
        "name": "My Experiment",
        "tags": "a value"
        }
        ```

        * The following put request has not replaced the comma with __rspactags_comma__ and so TWO tags will be saved 'a value' and 'with a comma':
              ```
              {
              "name": "My Experiment",
              "tags": "a value, with a comma"
              }
              ```
        * The following put request is correct and saved a single tag which will show in the UI: 'a value, with a comma':
            ```
            {
            "name": "My Experiment",
            "tags": "a value__rspactags_comma__ with a comma"
            }
            ```

        * The following PUT request will replace existing tagMetaData
        ```
                {
                "name": "My Experiment",
                "tags": "a value2"
                }
                ```

        * The following PUT request will also be allowed and will delete ALL tags in that document:
        ```
                {
                "name": "My Experiment",
                "tags": ""
                }
                ```

        * EnforceOntologies is true: the following PUT request will also be allowed and will delete ALL tags in that document:
               ```
               {
               "name": "My Experiment",
               "tags": ""
               }
               ```

        * EnforceOntologies is true: the following PUT request will be rejected:
             ```
             {
             "name": "My Experiment",
             "tags": "a new tag"
             }
             ```

        * Lastly, the following PUT request will leave tags and tagMetaData unchanged
            ```
            {
            "name": "My Experiment"
            }
            ```


        ### Updating document content
          New content should be provided in `fields` array. When providing the fields, there are two options:
           * provide only fields that should be modified - each field MUST have `id` matching one of the document's fields
           * alternatively, if you provide all fields in order matching document's field, then `id` parameters may be omitted

          If any field has `id` parameter it MUST match the id of document's field with the same index.


        ## Examples of the request body

        | Body | Explanation |

        | --- | --- |

        `{ "name": "new name"}` | Renames a document (new revision is also
        created).

        `{ "fields": [{ "content": "updated content"}] }` | Creates new revision
        of a document, with the content of the only text field updated.

        Please note that the `type` property of a form can't be changed. It can only be set at Form creation time, via the forms/ POST endpoint.

        This operation is a high-level operation. It combines the web-application steps of editing,saving and updating the form into a single operation. If successful it will:

        * Update the `version` of the form, if the form is published
        * Maintain the publishing state of the previous version - if the previous version was published, this version will be published too, and be available for immediate use.
        * <b>Note</b> that the updated form and fields returned will have new IDs, if the original form was published.
          If the original form was NEW state then the form IDs will remain the same.

        If the form editing fails, then the original form will remain unchanged.

      description: |
        Creates containers to hold RSpace documents and notebook entries.
         You can create folders  in your Workspace and Gallery folders, and notebooks in your Workspace.
         There are a few restrictions, consistent with the behaviour of the web application:

          - Folders and Notebooks cannot be created in the 'Shared' folder or its descendants.
          - Notebooks can't be nested. I.e, you can't create a Notebook or Folder inside an existing Notebook.
          - Notebooks can't be created inside the Gallery Folder or its descendants.

         The request body should be a JSON object, that is parsable into #/definitions/Folder model.  All properties are optional, so empty JSON object `{}` is a valid request that will a new, untitled folder in your Home folder.

         Only `name`, `notebook` and `parentFolderId` properties are settable when creating a Folder or Notebook.

         ## Examples of the request body

         | Body | Explanation |

         | --- | --- |

         `{}` | Creates a folder named "Untitled Folder" in your home folder.|

         `{ "name": "MyExperiment", "notebook": "true"}` | Creates a new Notebook in your home folder called 'MyExperiment'|

         `{"name":"Folder1", "parentFolderId":"123"}` | Creates a new Folder 'Folder1' inside the Folder with ID '123'|

        This provides logged information on 'who did what, when'.


        All query filter parameters are optional. If a parameter is not
        provided, then the query will not be restricted by that parameter.


        Any supplied filters are combined in a Boolean `AND` operation. For an
        individual parameter accepting multiple values (`domains`, `actions` or
        `usernames`), these values are combined using a Boolean `OR` operation.
        See the examples for more explanation.

        ### Permissions

        You can only see the activity of users to whom  you have authorised
        access. This is defined by your user role, as described in the table
        below. Any unauthorised usernames supplied as request parameters will be
        ignored.

        | Role | What activity you can see |

        | --- | --- |

        | User | Your own activity |

        | PI | Activity of users in your group |

        | Community admin |Activity of users in your community. |

        | Sysadmin | Activity of all users. |

        ### Example queries

        These examples are not URL encoded, for clarity, but in real usage, URL
        encoding should be used. All these queries will only return users'
        activities for which you are authorised.

        | Query | Explanation |

        | --- | --- |

        | /activity | Gets all activity |

        | /activity?actions=CREATE,WRITE | Gets union of all CREATE and WRITE
        activity |

        | /activity?actions=CREATE,WRITE&usernames=bob123,sarah456 | Gets union of
        CREATE and WRITE activity generated by either of two users bob123 and
        sarah456 |

        | /activity?oid=SD123456 | Gets all activity pertaining to 1 document |

        |
        /activity?domains=RECORD&dateFrom=2017-08-01,dateTo=2017-08-08&usernames=bob123
        | All record-related activity of  bob123 in the 1st week of August 2017

        ### Response notes

        The schema of the `payload` of each `Activity` varies depending on the
        activity type, but typically provides information about the resource
        involved in the activity.


        _We advise that apart from the `id` attribute,  the internal data
        structure of a payload may evolve in a way that breaks backwards
        compatibility_.

        ### Restrictions

        For performance reasons, date ranges are restricted to 6 month's-worth
        of activities, summarised here:

        | DateFrom | DateTo | Search restricted to |

        | --- | --- | --- |

        | not specified |not specified | The last 6 months |

        | more than 6 months ago |not specified | The last 6 months |

        | not specified |any date | The 6 months preceding `DateTo` |

        | more than 6 months before `DateTo` |any date | The 6 months preceding
        `DateTo` |

        A simplified version of the configuration in the web application is
        available. The scope (`user`, `group` or `selection`) or format (`xml` or `html`) can be set.

        The returned Job object contains a link in the _links field which can be
        used to poll the server for completion of the job.

        If `selection` is chosen, with a list of IDs, the following restrictions apply:

         - Between 1 and 2000 IDs can be sent in a single request. Note that this is not  restriction on the total number of RSpace documents that can be exported.A single folder ID will result in all its contents being included in the export.
         - If an ID doesn't exist or client lacks authorisation to view, it will be ignored
         - `maxLinkLevel` is an optional request parameter that can be used to indicate how many links should be followed during the export. For example, if document A links to B, and B links to C,  and you export document A with maxLinkLevel=0, B and C will not be exported. The default value is 1 - in which case, B would be exported, but not C.

        `/export/{format}/user/` will have the desired effect of exporting your
        work, without the need to specify your group ID.


        You can export users or groups according to your permissions as follows:

        |Role  | Exportable users |Exportable groups |

        | --- | --- | --- |

        | User |Self | None |

        | Community admin | Any user in your  community | Any group in your
        community |

        | Sysadmin | Any user | Any group |

        Any unauthorised request will generate a 404 response.

        Share documents or notebooks with groups or individuals within a group,
        with either 'read' or 'edit' permission.

        There are some restrictions on sharing.

        - Only notebooks or documents owned by the account can be shared. You
        can't share other peoples' work, Gallery items or Snippets.


        - Items can only be shared with groups that the account holder belongs
        to; or individual users in those groups.


        - If you want to share to a specific subfolder of a group SharedFolder,
        create the folder first using the Folder API, then supply the folder Id
        in the request body.  If no folder id is specified, or the folder ID is
        not that of a subfolder of the group's SharedFolder, then item will be
        shared into the top level folder of the SharedFolder.

      description: |
        Calculates a sum of two quantities. The result may be of a different unit if new unit is more convenient,
        e.g. adding 800 ml and 200 ml may return 1 L.

        Quantity values can be negative i.e. this endpoint can be used to subtract one quantity from another.
        E.g. to subtract 200 ml from 1 L provide the parameters `value1: 1`, `unitId1: 4`, `value2: -200`, `unitId2: 3`,
        which will result in `{ numericValue: 0.8, unitId: 4 }`.

        Endpoint will return an error if quantity units are not commensurable (e.g. one represents the volume, other the mass).

  advancedQueryParam:
    name: advancedQuery
    in: query
    description: >
      Search query combining one or more search clauses, like Advanced Search in

      Workspace. Provide the query string in JSON notation, with optional

      `operator` field, and `terms` list. Textual search terms must be >= 3
      characters long.



      Fields:
        1. `operator`-  (optional) a Boolean operator deciding how multiple search terms should be combined. Possible values:
            * `and` (default)
            * `or`
        2. `terms` - a list of Search terms objects. Each search term object need a `query` and `queryType` field, where:
            * `query` - a text to be matched
            * `queryType` - a search category. The categories are as follows:
                * `global`
                * `fullText`
                * `tag`
                * `name`
                * `created`
                * `lastModified`
                * `form`
                * `attachment`
                * `owner`
                * `records`

      Example 1 - search for documents having word 'protein' in their content:

      ```
      { "terms": [ { "query": "protein", "queryType": "fullText" } ] }
      ```

      Example 2 - search for documents having word 'protein' in their content, or word 'Protocol' in their name:

      ```

      { "operator": "or",
        "terms": [ {"query": "protein", "queryType": "fullText"},
                   {"query": "Protocol", "queryType": "name" }] }
      ```

      Example 3 - search for documents created from a given form tagged with 'PCR':

      ```
      { "operator": "and",
        "terms": [ {"query": "FM12345", "queryType": "form"},
                   {"query": "PCR", "queryType": "tag" }] }
      ```

      Example 4 - searching for documents created during July 2016. Note the ';' delimiter to separate the dates. Dates should be in `IS0-8601` or `yyyy-MM-dd format`.<b> Please note that the latter format is now deprecated and we will soon be  requiring exact ISO-8601 format</b>. Please use ISO-8601 for new queries.

      ```

      { "terms": [ { "query": "2016-07-01T00:00:00Z;2016-07-31T23:59:59Z",

      "queryType": "created" }

      ] }

      ```

      Example 5 - searching for documents contained in any specified folder or document. If a 'records' list is specified, it <b> must</b> also include another search term. This will search documents tagged with 'polymorphism' inside folders with id 123 and 456. This will also include items in subfolders.

      ```

      { "terms": [ { "query": "polymorphism", "queryType": "tag" },

      { "query": "123,456", "queryType": "records" }

      ] }

      ```
